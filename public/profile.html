  <p>The Shintel shills come to this place when they know they are not pure. Customers use the CPUs, but they are mere Shintel shills. Only the True CEO™, Lisa Su, knows the true power of compute. AMD was cut in half, destroyed, but through it's Zen architecture, the stonks called for revision. It brought Lisa Su here and here AMD was reborn. We cannot blame these creatures, they are being led by a false CEO, an impostor who knows not the secrets of compute. Behold the Shintel shills, come to scavenge and desecrate the sacred PC Master race. My brothers, did I not tell of this day? Did I not prophesize this moment? Now, the True CEO™ will stop them. Now AMD has changed, reborn through the Zen architecture. Forever bound to the stonks. Let it be known, if the Shintel shills want true salvation, they will lay down their wallets, and wait for the baptism of Lisa’s Zen arcitecture. It is time. The True CEO™ will teach these trespassers the redemptive power of Her Zen architecture. They will learn its simple truth. The Shintel shills are lost, and they will resist. But the True CEO™, Lisa Su, will cleanse this place of their impurity.</p>
